Many thanks in advance...A Few Starter Tips:--------------------Here's a couple of quick instructions to get you started with GayBlade (for more detailed information, read the manual):1.) If this is your first time playing GayBlade, start the game and enter the 'Roller' (by clicking on its icon) to roll new characters.  Enter four times, each time rolling a character.2.) Then enter the GB Lounge (by clicking on its icon); your newly rolled characters are there waiting for you to pick them up.  Click on the check box to the left of each character, this adds that character to your party (their name and stats appear on the right side of the screen). Exit the lounge.3.) Next click on the first character's button (on the upper right hand side of the screen) then enter the Store (by clicking on its icon).  Select a Lighter, Can of Mace, and Apron for each character by clicking on the check box next to these items.  When finished, exit the Store and click on the next character's button, enter the Store again.  Repeat step 3 for all characters until all have equipment.  You will need to read the manual or experiment on your own to discover what types of characters can use what types of equipment since not all types of characters can equip all types of equipment.4.) Now enter the dungeon (by clicking on its icon).  All you see is a dark screen.  Click on the "Items" button for any character, and now light your Lighter by holding the Option key down and clicking on its icon. Follow this by holding the Option key down and clicking on all of your other item icons for EACH character.  You have now equipped all of your equipment and are free to roam around the dungeon (make sure you don't drift too far away from the stairs).  5.) When you encounter a beastie, you can fight, parry, cast a magic spell, or use a magical item (which you won't have yet).  Experiment around, but remember that character take their turns sequentially (from top to bottom) and each character has a limited time to decide what to do.  The message update window (directly below the middle dungeon screen) will tell you which characters turn it is (or how much damage each character is sustaining from hits from creatures).6.) When the encounter is over (hopefully you've won), go back up the stairs and cure any damage in the Clinic, by clicking on the character's button you wish to heal, and then the Clinic icon. When your entire party is cured, you're ready for more fighting in the dungeon!  If you haven't won, you will be able to roll new characters and begin again.7.) The rest is up to you.  We HIGHLY recommend you read the entire manual as it contains information on spells, magical items, traps and treasure, and other general playing information, and tips!----Version 2.5's Features:1.) GayBlade now runs on 16 gray scale and multi-monitor systems.2.) Due to numerous player requests, you can now equip items in the Castle before entering the Dungeon!3.) More animation for spells, and creatures.4.) Item icon's now make an identifying sound when equipped.5.) Windows are now centered on monitors.6.) Interface improvements make the game easier to play.----
